# Data Integration Points Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the integration points and data flow between the three legacy systems: Orders Management, Contract Management, and Ticket Management systems. Understanding these integration points is crucial for designing a unified enterprise system.

## Cross-System Entity Mapping

### Customer/Organization Mapping
- **Orders System**: `Customer` entity
- **Tickets System**: `Organization` entity
- **Integration Point**: Customer and Organization represent the same business entity
- **Data Synchronization**: Customer information must be synchronized between systems

### Supplier Mapping
- **Orders System**: `Supplier` entity (basic supplier info)
- **Contracts System**: `Supplier` entity (comprehensive supplier data)
- **Integration Point**: Same supplier represented in both systems with different levels of detail
- **Data Synchronization**: Supplier master data should flow from Contracts to Orders

## Key Integration Scenarios

### 1. Order Creation with Supplier Validation

**Integration Flow:**

User Issue → Tickets System → Orders System → Contracts System → Tickets System


**Process:**
1. User reports order issue via Tickets System
2. Tickets System creates new support ticket
3. Tickets System retrieves order details from Orders System
4. Tickets System gets supplier contact information from Contracts System
5. Ticket assigned to appropriate team with full context

**Data Exchange:**
- Tickets → Orders: `orderId`, `customerId`
- Orders → Tickets: `orderDetails`, `orderStatus`, `customerInfo`
- Tickets → Contracts: `supplierId`
- Contracts → Tickets: `supplierContactInfo`, `supportTerms`

### 3. Contract-Driven Order Processing

**Integration Flow:**
Contract Update → Orders System → Tickets System


**Process:**
1. Contract terms updated in Contracts System
2. Orders System notified of contract changes
3. Active orders reviewed for contract compliance
4. Non-compliant orders flagged in Tickets System for review

**Data Exchange:**
- Contracts → Orders: `supplierContractUpdates`, `newTerms`
- Orders → Tickets: `orderComplianceIssues`, `affectedOrders`

## Integration Challenges and Data Inconsistencies

### Data Duplication Issues

**Supplier Information:**
- **Problem**: Supplier data maintained separately in Orders and Contracts systems
- **Impact**: Inconsistent supplier information, manual synchronization required
- **Risk**: Order processing with outdated supplier data

**Customer/Organization Data:**
- **Problem**: Customer information duplicated between Orders and Tickets systems
- **Impact**: Inconsistent customer service experience
- **Risk**: Support tickets not properly linked to order history

### Data Format Inconsistencies

**Date Formats:**
- Orders System: Java Date objects
- Contracts System: Excel date formats
- Tickets System: iTop timestamp format

**Identifier Standards:**
- Different primary key naming conventions across systems
- Lack of universal customer/supplier identifier

**Status Enumeration:**
- Different status values and state machines across systems
- No standardized status mapping between systems

## Current Integration Methods

### Manual Integration
- **Excel Export/Import**: Contract data manually exported and imported
- **Screen Scraping**: Manual data entry between systems
- **Email Notifications**: Manual communication of status changes

### Database-Level Integration
- **Direct Database Queries**: Limited direct database access between systems
- **Batch Synchronization**: Nightly data synchronization jobs (where implemented)

### API Integration (Limited)
- **REST APIs**: Limited API availability, primarily in Tickets System
- **Web Services**: Basic web service calls for data retrieval

## Recommended Integration Architecture

### Master Data Management

**Customer Master Data:**
- Establish single source of truth for customer information
- Implement real-time synchronization between Orders and Tickets systems
- Create customer unique identifier mapping

**Supplier Master Data:**
- Contracts System as master for supplier information
- Real-time supplier data flow to Orders System
- Automated supplier compliance checking

### Event-Driven Integration

**Order Events:**
- Order status changes trigger notifications to Tickets System
- Contract violations automatically create support tickets
- Payment issues generate finance team notifications

**Contract Events:**
- Contract renewals trigger order system updates
- Supplier compliance changes affect order processing
- Contract terminations suspend new orders

### Data Integration Platform

**Integration Hub:**
- Central integration platform managing all system connections
- Standardized data formats and transformation rules
- Real-time and batch integration capabilities
- Integration monitoring and error handling

## Integration Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Real-time supplier validation during order creation
- Automatic ticket creation for order issues
- Contract compliance monitoring for active orders
- Unified customer view across all systems

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Integration calls should not exceed 2-second response time
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for critical integration points
- **Scalability**: Support for 10x current transaction volume
- **Security**: Encrypted data transmission between systems

### Data Quality Requirements
- **Consistency**: Master data synchronized within 15 minutes
- **Accuracy**: Data validation rules enforced at integration points
- **Completeness**: Mandatory field validation across system boundaries
- **Timeliness**: Real-time updates for critical business events

## Migration Considerations

### Phased Integration Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Establish master data synchronization
2. **Phase 2**: Implement real-time order-contract integration
3. **Phase 3**: Enable automated ticket creation for order issues
4. **Phase 4**: Complete event-driven integration architecture

### Data Migration Strategy
- Historical data mapping and cleansing
- Parallel system operation during transition
- Rollback procedures for integration failures
- User training for new integrated workflows

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Integration Monitoring
- Real-time integration health dashboards
- Data synchronization status monitoring
- Performance metrics and SLA tracking
- Error logging and alerting

### Maintenance Procedures
- Regular data quality audits
- Integration point testing procedures
- Change management for system updates
- Documentation maintenance requirements
