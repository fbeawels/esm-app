# Orders Management System Analysis

## System Overview

The Orders Management System is a Java-based web application designed for order creation, tracking, and customer management. It serves as the central hub for processing customer orders, managing product catalogs, and coordinating with suppliers.

## Core Entities and Data Model

### Primary Entities

**Customer**
- `customerId` (Long) - Primary key
- `customerName` (String) - Customer display name
- `contactInfo` (String) - Contact details
- `address` (String) - Customer address

**Product**
- `productId` (Long) - Primary key  
- `productName` (String) - Product display name
- `description` (String) - Product description
- `price` (BigDecimal) - Unit price
- `stockLevel` (Integer) - Available inventory
- `supplierId` (Long) - Foreign key to Supplier

**Supplier**
- `supplierId` (Long) - Primary key
- `supplierName` (String) - Supplier display name
- `contactInfo` (String) - Contact details
- `address` (String) - Supplier address

**Order**
- `orderId` (Long) - Primary key
- `customerId` (Long) - Foreign key to Customer
- `status` (OrderStatus) - Current order status
- `orderDate` (Date) - Order creation date
- `totalAmount` (BigDecimal) - Total order value
- `deliveryAddress` (String) - Shipping address

**OrderItem**
- `orderItemId` (Long) - Primary key
- `orderId` (Long) - Foreign key to Order
- `productId` (Long) - Foreign key to Product
- `quantity` (Integer) - Ordered quantity
- `unitPrice` (BigDecimal) - Price per unit
- `lineTotal` (BigDecimal) - Line item total

### Entity Relationships

- Customer → Order (1:N) - One customer can place multiple orders
- Order → OrderItem (1:N) - One order contains multiple line items
- Product → OrderItem (1:N) - One product can appear in multiple orders
- Supplier → Product (1:N) - One supplier provides multiple products

## Order Lifecycle and Workflows

### Order Status States

1. **incoming** - Newly created, pending validation
2. **approved** - Validated and ready for processing
3. **shipped** - Dispatched to customer
4. **payment_debts** - Payment pending reconciliation
5. **canceled** - Order terminated

### State Transitions

[] → incoming : Order Created
incoming → approved : Validate Order
incoming → canceled : Reject Order
approved → shipped : Process Order
approved → canceled : Cancel Order
shipped → payment_debts : Track Payment
shipped → [] : Complete Order
payment_debts → [] : Settle Payment
canceled → []


### Business Workflows

**Order Creation Process:**
1. Customer and product data collected via UI
2. Order items validated against inventory
3. Initial status set to "incoming"
4. Database record created with referential integrity checks

**Order Processing Workflow:**
1. Staff review incoming orders
2. Inventory levels checked before approval
3. Status transitions managed via controlled UI actions
4. Payment validation required before completion

## Business Rules and Validations

- Orders must be linked to valid customers
- OrderItems must reference existing products with valid quantities
- Inventory levels checked before order approval
- Status transitions are controlled (only "incoming" orders can be approved)
- Payment validation required before marking orders as complete
- Referential integrity enforced via foreign keys

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java Servlet-based web application
- **Frontend**: JSP with JSTL
- **Database**: MariaDB (relational)
- **Deployment**: Docker-based with dev/prod configurations

### Core Components
- `OrderServlet` - HTTP request handling
- `OrderService` - Business logic implementation
- `OrderDAO` - Database operations
- `OrderStatus` - Status enumeration
- `OrderValidator` - Data validation
- `order.jsp` - User interface

### Database Schema Example
CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
order_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
status ENUM('incoming','approved','shipped','payment_debts','canceled') NOT NULL,
total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
shipping_address TEXT NOT NULL,
payment_method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);


## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations
- **PDF Generation**: LaTeX integration for invoice creation
- **Map Services**: OpenStreetMap integration for delivery locations
- **Database Layer**: MariaDB for persistent storage

### External Integration Capabilities
- Payment gateways (potential)
- Inventory management systems
- ERP system connections
- Supplier portals

## Technical Limitations and Debt

### Performance Considerations
- Relies on database indexing and caching for scalability
- May require optimization for high-volume scenarios
- Complex business rules could impact maintainability

### Architecture Limitations
- JSP-based UI may limit modern user experience
- Tightly coupled integrations may require refactoring for extensibility
- Potential code duplication in service/DAO layers

### Recommended Improvements
- Enhanced modularization and test coverage
- Migration to modern frontend frameworks
- Improved caching strategies
- Enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities
