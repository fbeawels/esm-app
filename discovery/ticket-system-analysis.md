**DeliveryModel**
- `deliveryModelId` (Long) - Primary key
- `organizationId` (Long) - Foreign key to Organization
- `teams` (List<Team>) - Assigned teams

### Entity Relationships

- Organization → Ticket (1:N) - Organizations can have multiple tickets
- Service → Ticket (1:N) - Services can be associated with multiple tickets
- Team → Ticket (1:N) - Teams can handle multiple tickets
- User → Ticket (1:N) - Users can work on multiple tickets
- Ticket → Ticket (1:N) - Parent-child ticket relationships
- Organization → CustomerContract (1:N) - Organizations have multiple contracts
- CustomerContract → Service (N:N) - Contracts cover multiple services
- Organization → DeliveryModel (1:N) - Organizations use delivery models
- DeliveryModel → Team (N:N) - Delivery models include multiple teams

## Ticket Lifecycle and Workflows

### Ticket Status States

1. **New** - Ticket awaiting triage
2. **Assigned** - Ticket assigned but work not started
3. **InProgress** - Work actively ongoing
4. **Pending** - Waiting for external input
5. **Resolved** - Solution implemented
6. **Closed** - Ticket verified and completed

### State Transitions

[*] → New : Ticket Created
New → Assigned : Assign to Team/Agent
Assigned → InProgress : Start Work
InProgress → Pending : Wait for Info
Pending → InProgress : Resume Work
InProgress → Resolved : Resolve Issue
Resolved → Closed : Verify and Close
Resolved → InProgress : Reopen Issue

### Business Workflows

**Ticket Creation Process:**
1. User creates ticket specifying Organization, Service, and description
2. System links ticket to appropriate CustomerContract and DeliveryModel
3. Ticket categorized by type (Incident/Service Request) and priority
4. SLA deadlines calculated based on service agreements

**Assignment Process:**
1. Ticket assigned to Team (constrained by Delivery Model)
2. Optional assignment to specific agent within team
3. Assignment validation ensures team is authorized for customer
4. Notification sent to assigned team/agent

**Resolution Process:**
1. Assigned team/agent works ticket through lifecycle
2. SLA compliance monitored and escalated if needed
3. Resolution details recorded with closure
4. Customer notification and satisfaction tracking

## Business Rules and Validations

### Assignment Rules
- Tickets can only be assigned to teams in the customer's Delivery Model
- Team-service assignment constrained by delivery model, not direct service links
- Assignment changes must maintain delivery model compliance

### Categorization Rules
- All tickets must be linked to Organization and Service
- Ticket type classification (Incident vs Service Request) required
- Priority calculation based on impact and urgency matrices

### Relationship Rules
- Parent-child relationships supported (one parent, multiple children)
- Removing relationships doesn't delete objects, only links
- Relationship changes only saved when object edition finalized

### SLA Rules
- SLA deadlines automatically computed based on linked service agreements
- Response and resolution times tracked per SLA
- Escalation triggered on SLA violations

## Technical Architecture

### System Framework
- **Base Platform**: iTop framework with modular architecture
- **Database**: Relational database with complex relationship support
- **Interface**: Web-based interface for all user roles
- **API**: REST API for external integrations and automation

### Core Modules
- **Ticket Management**: Core incident and request handling
- **Service Management**: Service catalog and SLA management
- **User Management**: User roles and permission management
- **CMDB Integration**: Configuration item linking and impact analysis

### Workflow Engine
- State machine manages ticket status transitions
- Configurable stimuli (events) trigger state changes
- Mandatory field validation for state transitions
- Custom workflow support for specific business needs

## Integration Points

### Internal System Integrations
- **Orders System**: Ticket creation for order-related issues, order detail retrieval
- **Contracts System**: Supplier contact information for escalation

### External System Integrations
- **CMDB**: Configuration item linking for impact analysis
- **Monitoring Tools**: Automated incident creation from monitoring alerts
- **Email Systems**: Notification and communication management
- **External Partners**: REST API for partner system integration

### Integration Capabilities
- REST API for system-to-system communication
- Email integration for notification management
- Custom connector support for specialized integrations
- Workflow automation for external system updates

## Technical Limitations and Debt

### Current Limitations
- Team-service assignment complexity requires delivery model management
- Relationship management can lead to orphaned data if not properly maintained
- Complex custom workflows may require advanced configuration
- Performance impact in very large environments without proper tuning

### Scalability Considerations
- Large ticket volumes may require database optimization
- Complex relationship queries may impact performance
- Workflow customization may affect system maintainability

### Recommended Improvements
- Enhanced relationship management automation
- Performance tuning for high-volume environments
- Simplified team-service assignment models
- Enhanced workflow customization tools
- Improved integration monitoring and management
